description: 'Configure K21 to process existing video or image files'
---

The `setCapturerFromFile` method configures K21 to process an existing video (.mp4) or image (.png) file instead of capturing from screen. This is useful when you want to analyze pre-recorded content.

## Usage

```javascript
const k21 = new K21();

k21.setCapturerFromFile({
  file: './recordings/screen-capture.mp4'
});
```

## CaptureFromFileConfig Interface

The configuration object requires the following parameter:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `file` | `string` | Yes | Path to the file to be processed. Must be either .mp4 or .png |

## Supported File Types

- Video files (`.mp4`)
- Image files (`.png`)

## Examples

### Process a Video File
```javascript
k21.setCapturerFromFile({
  file: './captures/meeting-recording.mp4'
});
```

### Process a Screenshot
```javascript
k21.setCapturerFromFile({
  file: './screenshots/dashboard.png'
});
```

## Error Handling

The method will throw an error in these cases:
- If a screen capturer is already set
- If the file path is not provided
- If the file type is not supported (must be .mp4 or .png)
- If the file path is invalid

```javascript
try {
  k21.setCapturerFromFile({
    file: './recordings/video.avi' // Unsupported format
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to set file capturer:', error.message);
  // Error: File must be either .mp4 or .png
}
```

## Important Notes

1. You cannot use `setCapturerFromFile` if you've already set a screen capturer using `setCapturer`
2. The file must exist and be accessible when the method is called
3. Make sure you have appropriate permissions to read the file
