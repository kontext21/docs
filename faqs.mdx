Kontext21 is the AI infrastructure layer for user context. 

K21 SDK makes it easy to personalize software by capturing & retrieving end-user context from sources like their screen, browser and many more.

With computer use and browser use there is usually no way to get back structured data about what’s going on for the user. Kontext21 can be used to trigger computer use or also to build your own, highly customized version of computer use.

## Why should we use this instead of integrating directly with model XY?

You can always re-invent the wheel. Kontext21 provides model agnostic infrastructure layer to build context aware software applications. Using a model is only part of the work to be done. 

- Received structured output
- Merge with different sources of context both from within your software (known entities such as contacts, projects etc.) but also from outside your software (see our list of integrations
- Both experimentation as well as testing & observability are crucial.
- Remove PII information
- Optimize for cost
- Easy experimentation with different models

## What are the development stages for context aware AI Apps

1. Experimentation
2. Implement
3. Beta Launch - Make it on-demand, side-by-side installer
4. Production Launch - Include in main installer
5. Continuous Improvement

## What will pricing be like?
