As developer this let’s you answer questions like:

* “What is my user currently doing?”

* “Which contacts are important to her?”

* “What is his most likely next action?”

<Accordion title="Example - Todo Inc." defaultOpen={false} icon="circle-info">
  - We offer a todo tracking web app (SaaS)&#x20;

  - Our users are frustrated to manually start/stop tasks.&#x20;

  - Instead they expect AI and automation

  - With Kontext21 we can build automated task tracking into our web app.
</Accordion>

Steps to build user-centric software:

* Take the first steps by following our Getting Started guide
