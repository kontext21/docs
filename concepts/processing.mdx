## Overview

K21 processes captured content through OCR and Vision models to extract meaningful insights from user interactions.

## Processing Methods

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

OCR extracts text from captured screens using multiple engines. The system supports native OS OCR and Tesseract, with multi-language capabilities and spatial awareness. Each extraction includes confidence scoring for accuracy assessment.

### Vision Models

Vision models provide deeper understanding of screen content. The system analyzes screen layouts, recognizes UI elements, and tracks user interactions. Semantic content understanding enables comprehensive interface analysis.

### Future Processing

Additional processing capabilities are in development. The system will support custom processor plugins and multi-modal processing. Audio transcription and temporal analysis will enhance context understanding.
