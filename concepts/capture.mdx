## Sources of Context

- Screen - Screen21
- OS Integrations
- Cloud/Web integrations
- Browser Extensions
- Bring your own data

## How to get the “context” of your users?

- If you already have a desktop installer, then implement our SDK, the binaries will be included into your installer.
- if you build a webapp or low-code dev without installer you can:
    - Web Capture (start a screenshare)
    - Use our installer
        - Use Kontext21.exe - Ready to go, fastest option
        - Whitelabel Installer - Most useful if you are a webapp and want a branded Installer MyApp Tracker.exe - We take care of everything
        - For installer we also take care of “always running in the back”, trouble shooting & error logs & auto-updates, certification and permissions
    - "Bring your own data" You implement your own capturing logic, then File Upload Screenshot or .mp4 to a cloud procressor
