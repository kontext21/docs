## Overview

K21 captures user context through various methods, with screen capture as the primary method. The system is designed for efficiency and minimal system impact.

## Capture Sources

### Screen Capture

Screen capture is the core method for understanding user interactions. K21 maintains low system impact while supporting configurable frame rates and flexible storage options. The system adapts to both real-time monitoring and periodic analysis needs.

### Future Capture Methods

Additional capture methods are in development. Browser Extensions will provide direct DOM access and web interaction tracking. System Integration will track application focus and window management. Audio Capture will support voice commands and meeting recordings. Cloud/Web Integration will enable cross-platform awareness and service synchronization.
